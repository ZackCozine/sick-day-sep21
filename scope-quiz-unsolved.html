    // Run this program. Then turn to the person next to you and answer the following questions:
    // 1. What is the difference (in output) between Situation 1 and Situation 2?
    // 2. Why are the alert messages different? (Hint: Look for syntax differences)

    // Situation 1
    // ------------------------------------------
    var myVar1 = 1;

    function a1() {
      myVar1 = 5 - 3;
      b1();
      alert("Q1 | a: " + myVar1);
    }

    function b1() {
      alert("Q1 | b: " + myVar1);
    }
    a1();


    // Situation 2
    // ------------------------------------------
    var myVar2 = 1;

    function a2() {
      var myVar2 = 5 - 3;
      b2();
      alert("Q2 | a: " + myVar2);
    }

    function b2() {
      alert("Q2 | b: " + myVar2);
    }
    a2();
//situation 1 sets myVar1 to 5-3 which is 2 then runs function b1 after changing the value of myvar1
//situation 2 there is a var in front of myVar2 so it is redeclared instead of having the value changed ot be called upon later
//I think that is the reason that you get the differences in alert messages even though the two situations
//look nearly identical
